								<h2>I wish I had <i>this</i></h2>
								<p>To me, micro gifting isn't about fixing poverty, teaching
									lessons, or promising change. It's sweet, simple, and selfish.
									It's childhood Turibius's wish from when he was in Bangladesh:<br />
								<b>I wish I had <i>this</i>.</b><br />
								I wished I had a RC drone. I wished I had nerf guns. I wished I
									had the fish catching toy that I begged mom to buy, but she said
									no&mdash;because she knew we couldn't readily afford it.<br />
									<br />
								And I wished&mdash;that one day when I grow up&mdash;I would see a child
									begging his mom for a fish catching toy, and I would buy it for
									them. No speeches, no expectations, not even needing the toy to
									last. It's just a gift.
									<br /><br />
								Micro gifting is that wish, handed forward. I don't need anything
								back. I don't expect anything back. I just want to hand little
								Turibius a gift that he could once only wish for.

								<h2>Brief Scope</h2>
								<p>Micro gifting is an idea, free of charge, with no
									acknowledgements required. It is not a charity, scholarship, nor
									financial support. There is no promise of future rounds, no cash
									gifts, no political/religious/marketing agendas.<br /> <br />
								Micro gifting involves a fundamental human-to-human connection, and
								as such, its size is limited by the capabilities of the real people
								running it. <br /> <br />
								And just like a gift, don't expect anything in return. No photos, no
								testimonials, no surveys&mdash;ever.</p> </header>
