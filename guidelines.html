								<h3>Scope</h3>
								<p>
Micro gifting is an idea, free of charge, with no acknowledgements required. It is not a charity,
scholarship, nor financial support. There is no promise of future rounds, no cash gifts, no
political/religious/marketing agendas. </p>

								<p>
Micro gifting involves a fundamental human-to-human connection, and as such, its size is limited by
the capabilities of the real people running it. Nonetheless, micro gifting isn't a single program:
it's an idea that anyone can take, modify, and implement. If you have personal connections with
people from a different country or neighborhood, I encourage you to start your own micro gifting
unit. Feel free to utilize any and all of the methodologies, logistics, and concepts that we present
here. If you are starting your own unit and want a website, feel free to reach out to me, and I can
create a subdomain for you, free of charge: <code>https://&lt;your_unit&gt;.microgift.ing</code>.
								</p>

								<p>
This micro gifting unit is intended to be between my personal connections in the US (which is a More
Economically Developed Country), and BACHA English Medium School of Bangladesh (which is a Less
Economically Developed Country). The target number of children to support initially is 20 to 40
children per year, which is the approximate size of grades 7 through 10. Higher grades have less
students, which is ideal for initial runs as it requires less people to fund gifts, and creates less
logistical and managerial load for my Bangladeshi friends trying to see this through: they are
people too! Over time, the goal is to give gifts to students of lower grades (and hence more
students), and eventually children from other poorer schools. Approximately 20 to 40 gifters are
needed at the MEDC, depending on the size of their donation, number of children at the LEDC, and the
ratio of purchasing power between MEDC and LEDC. Some gifts may be carried over or re-donated by
students, in which case, this surplus will gradually enable us to prioritize lower grade levels
which have more and more students. </p>

								<p>
The pilot study would start off with scaleable small gifts (more on that later). Throughout the
entire process, the number of students gifted per year will be limited; otherwise it is no longer
"micro" gifting. Similarly, gifts must not be too expensive, or require expensive pre-requisites
(such as personal computers). Different units can be formed for different schools, or multiple units
can be formed for large schools with hundreds of students per batch. Either way, </i>don't bite more
than what you can chew</i>. The people doing the most work are the friends and teachers at the LEDC:
they have their own lives, and I want to ensure that my hopes and dreams don't crush theirs. </p>

								<p>
Don’t expect anything in return. No photos, testimonials, or surveys are required—ever. If a student
wants to share what they’ve built or learned, that’s their choice. We’ll support photos, videos, and
write-ups only when initiated by the children, at the 
<a href="https://github.com/turibiusrozario/microgifting/discussions">discussion page</a>.  
It’s optional, moderated for safety, and ad-free. </p>

								<p>
Teachers and coordinators: Some toys will break or get lost—that’s okay. Offer basic guidance (like
how to drive a RC car) and ensure age-appropriate safety. Typically, these shouldn’t require
instruction beyond simple safety reminders. </p>
								<hr />

								<h3>Monetary Logistics</h3>

<p>Each donor in MEDC can donate however much they want to donate. In the initial pilot phase, the
	number of donors will be limited to slowly build up experience, expectations, and understandings
	of micro gifting. In general, the process is:</p> 
<ol> <li> <strong>Collection at MEDC:</strong>
<ul> <li>Collected by a single account via Venmo/PayPal/Zelle, etc. Collection records will be
		publicly available on a spreadsheet for transparency. Donors can use pseudonyms for the
		public spreadsheet.</li> 
	<li>The spreadsheet will be publicly viewable</li> 
	<li>New donation
		spreadsheet will be created for each round of micro gifting</li> 
	<li>No tax receipts will be
		issued; these are personal gifts, not charitable deductions</li> 
	<li>All funds have to be in
		by a set date, after which it gets transferred</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li> <strong>Transfer to
		LEDC</strong> 
	<ul> 
		<li><em>Wise</em> will be utilized to transfer the funds to LEDC. Here,
		the first overhead has to be paid: cost to transfer funds internationally. <em>Wise</em>
		seems to have the lowest international transfer rates. The amount of funds received will be
		listed on the spreadsheet</li> 
		<li>Funds transferred to single bank account. Mobile wallet
		such as bKash may be used for initial rounds</li> 
	</ul> </li> 
	<li> <strong>Use at
		LEDC</strong> 
		<ul> 
			<li>Local coordinator(s) will locally purchase items. This supports the
		local business.</li> 
			<li>Initial rounds can be done by simply going to a store and making
		the purchase</li> 
			<li>Later rounds would need bulk purchases (in this case, educational
		discounts could be pursued)</li> 
			<li>All receipts and vendor details should be uploaded.
		Coordinator(s) are encouraged to collect as much evidence of individual items as
		possible.</li> 
			<li>If a item is not sold in person at LEDC, only then could it be purchased
		online; receipts should include shipping fee if any</li> 
			<li>Each local coordinator will be
		paid <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"> <mi>t</mi>

		<p>If continuation happens, this will be gradually scaled

			 give larger gifts, and establish separate MEDC account to separate personal and micro
			 gifting funds.</p>

		<hr />
		<h3>Gift Logistics</h3>

<p>Several <em>sets</em> of gift lists will be generated. The set selected will be based on amount of funding available and number of students. If funds are high, it may make sense to purchase Arduino Uno kits over books as gifts. Such scaleable sets could be 'blended' if needed (e.g. 50% Arduino Uno kits + 50% books)</p>

<p>Let
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mi>p</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mrow>

  be the maximum price of a gift per student for a given round (this factors in coordinator overhead). Multiple sets have to be prepared to reach, but not exceed
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mi>p</mi></math>. Gifters can propose what the sets would look like, and are encouraged to review the core purpose of micro gifting during the process. Make a post in the <a href="https://github.com/turibiusrozario/microgifting/discussions">discussions page</a> for this.</p>

<p>Gifts will be age-appropriate and simple to use. For lower batches, this would entail avoiding things such as sling shots, RC helicopters, and the like. Safety instructions will be placed where necessary. Keep in mind that we are not OSHA or some federal agency who knows all the safety procedures: we will list safety instructions to the best of our abilities based on what information is readily accessible. For 'blended' gifts, gifts will be distributed fairly: this could be a simple rotation based distribution or going through a list of student names, or allowing students to choose their 'categories' of gifts they like.</p>

<p>Local coordinator(s) have a lot of responsibilities during this phase:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Confirming the number of students in the target class with the teacher.</li>
  <li>Locating the gifts to purchase</li>
  <li>Ensuring that there are <em>enough</em> gifts to purchase + 1 extra for every 17 students</li>
  <li>Ensuring that the gifts are within budget</li>
  <li>Ensuring that, for electronic gifts especially, the critical components are purchased (e.g. it would be pointless to buy a RC car without batteries)</li>
  <li>Ensuring that the gifts work (e.g. Arduino Uno kits turn on, books are not worn, etc.)</li>
  <li>Attaining bulk prices if possible</li>
  <li>Transporting the items, designating storage</li>
  <li>Setting up a time to distribute the gifts to the students <em>directly</em></li>
  <li>Recording evidence of the distribution</li>
  <li>Providing a short description as necessary (what the gifts are, expectations (or rather, the lack thereof), any information about safety)</li>
  <li>Send recap: the receipts, vendor details, quantity, and, quite importantly, about any difficulties or ways to improve.</li>
</ol>

<p>After each round, we reflect: what worked, what didn’t, vendor reliability, student engagement, teacher workload. We adjust sets, budgets, and timelines accordingly.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="scale-up">Scale up</h3>
<p>There is no expectation of continuation. If we do continue, there will be no more than two rounds
	per year, near semester ends. If a semester round isn’t feasible (school closures, funding gaps, logistics), we simply skip it—no make-up or obligation. We may pause or stop at any time without obligation. If funds remain after a canceled round, they will roll forward or be refunded during pilots.</p>
<p>As described in the Scope, the size of this micro giving will be limited to people I personally know. I expect others may want to recreate micro giving—and I welcome it. Some may choose a centralized model, may earn profits, or may attach political or religious agendas. Others may run versions that uplift people more, reduce poverty, or simply do it better. That’s all fine. Micro giving is an idea—free of charge, with no acknowledgements required—that anyone can use, centralize, modify, monetize, or improve. To me, the concept itself is a gift; I expect nothing in return.</p>
<p>Even when I say “I expect nothing in return,” a kind of inherent expectation can be felt. The
	simple act of foreigners giving a gift with nothing in exchange can spark urges to showcase
	student work, send thank-you notes, or offer to help. I fully expect that some students (not
all) may figure out who donated, reach out, and share gratitude—or ask how they can contribute. I
can’t stop those feelings of expectation, and I wouldn’t want to stop the desire to give back. So
I’ll point you to the <a href="https://microgift.ing/">Purpose</a> of micro giving: look at the gift in your hands. I’m sure you’ll see that, in your hands, it’s more than just a gift.</p>

I do want to give people a chance&mdash;the choice to learn things they
otherwise wouldn't learn, the opportunity to do good, and the sliver of hope to
unlearn <a href="">learned helplessness</a>&mdash;and I'm sure you'd want to do it too. That's why
